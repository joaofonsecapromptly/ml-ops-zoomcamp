- Branch development: use git branches to organize your work. Each task is a branch with a PR.

# Module 1
## 1 - Local Env Setup (macOs)

1.1. Check [Local MacOS envprep by Adetbekov](https://github.com/adetbekov/mlops-zoomcamp/blob/main/01-intro/macos-local-envprep.md) for Docker setup

1.2. Package Version Control using Poetry

- Install poetry: `pip install poetry`
- Start environemnt: `poetry init` which will create a `pyproject.toml` file with main dependencies. Feel free to skip dependency and install them later using `poetry add`
- Start a .venv `poetry shell` and add .venv to `.gitignore`
